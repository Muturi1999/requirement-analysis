# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

Welcome to the **Requirement Analysis** repository.

This repository is dedicated to exploring the foundational phase of the software development life cycle â€” **Requirement Analysis**. It outlines the process of gathering, analyzing, and documenting stakeholder needs and system expectations before design and implementation begin.

The goal of this project is to understand how accurate and thorough requirement analysis leads to successful software solutions by aligning technical development with real-world needs.
